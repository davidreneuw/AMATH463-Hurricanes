\chapter{Writeup plan and task breakdown}

This project will focus mainly on deriving the governing equation of hurricane formation and verifying them using existing computational models and will be separated into the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Abstract}: Provides an overview of the project, the theory used and the conclusions obtained in short form as well as related keywords and topics.
    \item \textbf{Introduction}: Provides a motivation for this project as well as background context.
    \item \textbf{Theory}: Introduces the background theory needed as well as all relevant derivations needed in obtaining the governing equations of hurricane formation.
    \item \textbf{Computational Model} (time permitting): Provides a comparison between existing hurricane models such as HWRF or GSF and our derived equations.
    \item \textbf{Conclusion}: Discusses possible issues with our methods as well as possible improvements.
\end{itemize}

In addition, here is a proposed breakdown of tasks in order to facilitate the progression of our project.
