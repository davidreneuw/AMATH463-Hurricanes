\chapter{Goal Outline}
As mathematical physics student in the faculty of science, we share an interest in the mathematics of geophysical fluids as well as computational analysis. We found the topic of hurricane formation quite interesting and applicable. With this project, we hope to derivate the underlying equations pertaining to the formation of hurricanes and, time permitting, use a simplistic computational model of hurricane formation to support our derivations.\\
Additional (optional) goals are to observe changes caused by varying different parameters as well as varying the Coriolis forces (simulating different physical position).
