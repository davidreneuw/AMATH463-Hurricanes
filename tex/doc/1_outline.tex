\chapter{Goal Outline}
As mathematical physics student in the faculty of science, we share an interest in the mathematics of geophysical fluids as well as computational analysis. We found the topic of hurricane formation quite interesting and applicable. With this project, we hope to provide a simplistic computational model of hurricane formation based on geophysical parameters such as air pressure, temperature and density. We expect the main challenges of this project to be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a 3D model which evolves in time
    \item Solving 3D partial differential equations in python
    \item Implement forces dues to the Coriolis effect 
\end{itemize}
Additional (optional) goals are to observe changes caused by varying different parameters as well as varying the Coriolis forces (simulating different physical position).
