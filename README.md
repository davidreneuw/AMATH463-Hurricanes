# AMATH 463: Fluid Dynamics
### Hurricanes
### David Ren√© & Petra M. Duff

As part of our AMATH463: Fluid Dynamics course, we were required to work on a term project related to fluid dynamics. As we are both mathematical physics student with an interest in mathematics of geophysical fluids, we decided to attempt a numerical/computational analysis of the creation of hurricanes

## Setup

In an anaconda prompt from the base of this repository:
```
conda env create -f src/environment.yml
conda activate hurricane
jupyter notebook
```
And navigate to `src/Hurricanes.ipynb`.
